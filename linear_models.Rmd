```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)

set.seed(1)
```

Use aribnb dataset practice linear modles

```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb")

nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(stars = review_scores_location / 2) %>% 
  rename(
    boro = neighbourhood_group,
    neighborhood = neighbourhood) %>% 
  filter(boro != "Staten Island") %>% 
  select(price, stars, boro, neighborhood, room_type)
```

Fit a first linear model

```{r}
fit = lm(price ~ stars + boro, data = nyc_airbnb)
```

```{r}
fit

summary(fit)
#restract the coefficient
coef(fit)
summary(fit)$coef

```

tidy the results instead!

```{r}
fit %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate(term = str_replace(term, "boro", "Boro: ")) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
# look at others included in the test
fit %>% 
  broom::glance()
```


## Take a look at factors

```{r}
nyc_airbnb = nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(
    boro = fct_infreq(boro),
    room_type = fct_infreq(room_type)
  )
# look the same but have been ordered in the inside
```


refit the last model

```{r}
fit = lm(price ~ stars + boro, data = nyc_airbnb)

fit %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```
